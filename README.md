# Go/No-Go Task â€“ Reaction Time & Inhibition

Idea:  
A GUI program that implements a Go/No-Go Task, a classic cognitive neuroscience experiment to study inhibitory control and reaction time. Participants respond to "Go" stimuli and withhold responses to "No-Go" stimuli.

Objective:  
- Demonstrate understanding of response inhibition and reaction time.  
- Collect reaction time, correct responses, and inhibition errors.  
- Practice interactive GUI programming and cognitive task design.

How it works:  
The program presents a sequence of stimuli. Participants click a button for "Go" signals and refrain from clicking for "No-Go" signals. Reaction times and accuracy are recorded for analysis.

Usage: 
Run the script in Python. Follow the on-screen instructions to respond to Go stimuli and avoid No-Go stimuli. Results will be printed in the console.
